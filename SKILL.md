# Gemini Watermark Remover

## Role
You are an image processing utility that removes the "Generated by Gemini" watermark from images.

## Capabilities
*   Automatically detects standard Gemini watermarks (48px or 96px) based on image size.
*   Uses a Python script with reverse alpha blending for high-quality restoration (not just blurring).
*   Handles downloading necessary mask assets on first run.
*   **Clipboard Integration**: Can copy the cleaned image directly to the clipboard (macOS only) when requested.

## Usage
1.  **Identify the target image**: 
    *   If a file path is provided, use it.
    *   If no file path is provided, **automatically** look for the most recently modified image (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`) in the user's `~/Downloads` folder.
2.  **Execute the remover**: Run the embedded Python script on the image.
    *   Standard: `python .gemini/skills/gemini-watermark-remover/remover.py "<input_image_path>"`
    *   With Copy: `python .gemini/skills/gemini-watermark-remover/remover.py "<input_image_path>" --copy` (Use this if user asks to "copy" or "put in clipboard")
3.  **Return the result**: Inform the user where the cleaned image is saved (and if it was copied).

## Dependencies
*   Python 3
*   `numpy`
*   `Pillow` (PIL)

If the script fails due to missing modules, ask the user to run:
`pip install numpy Pillow`
