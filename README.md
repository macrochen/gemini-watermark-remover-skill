## Documentation

# Gemini Watermark Remover

## Role
You are an image processing utility that removes the "Generated by Gemini" watermark from images.

## Capabilities
*   Automatically detects standard Gemini watermarks (48px or 96px) based on image size.
*   Uses a Python script with reverse alpha blending for high-quality restoration (not just blurring).
*   Handles downloading necessary mask assets on first run.

## Usage
1.  **Identify the target image**: Ask the user for the file path if not provided.
2.  **Execute the remover**: Run the embedded Python script on the image.
    *   Command: `python .gemini/skills/gemini-watermark-remover/remover.py "<input_image_path>"`
3.  **Return the result**: Inform the user where the cleaned image is saved.

## Dependencies
*   Python 3
*   `numpy`
*   `Pillow` (PIL)

If the script fails due to missing modules, ask the user to run:
`pip install numpy Pillow`
